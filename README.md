📌 How to Run Any Program

Option 1: Run in Terminal

python filename.py

Option 2: Run in VS Code / PyCharm

Open the file

Click Run


Option 3: Run in Google Colab

# For testing functions
solution = Solution()
print(solution.functionName(input_values))

Option 4: Run LeetCode Code Locally

Add this at the bottom of the file:

if __name__ == "__main__":
    obj = Solution()
    print(obj.functionName(test_input))
