## ▶️ How to Run Any Program

### **Option A — Using Python on your system**

1. Open a terminal
2. Navigate to the folder containing the file
3. Run:

```
python filename.py
```

---

### **Option B — Running in Google Colab**

1. Upload the `.py` file to Colab
2. Add a cell:

```python
!python filename.py
```

3. Run the cell

---

### **Option C — Direct Execution in an IDE**
